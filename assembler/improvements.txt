1. use the new and better AST for better VM project
2. instead of recursion on list, just use List.map, makes it much simpler to look at (maybe, try it out)
3. after using the new AST, remake the parser to make use of the improved AST. (NOTE: dont spend too much time on parser)
4. learn about parsing and shift/reduce conflict, to understand it better
